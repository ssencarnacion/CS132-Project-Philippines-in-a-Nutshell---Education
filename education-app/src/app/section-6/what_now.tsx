                Based on the results, there are <b>disparities in educational access across regions</b>  in the Philippines. Key factors affecting access include basic literacy, functional literacy, and overall literacy levels, though these factors show low correlation. Despite education being a fundamental human need, many Filipinos still lack access to it. Every individual has the right to quality education. Therefore, education issues, particularly in areas with limited access, must be addressed, and improvements to the education system are crucial.

                We have the <b>following recommendations</b> based on our results and limitations to further improve and explore data regarding educational access in the Philippines:<br></br><br></br>
                • Features of the FLEMMS dataset do not include potential factors that influence education access such as household income, political, and others. <br></br><br></br>
                • Factors and circumstances of each region could be included in the scope of research to further explore the main factors that influence education access<br></br><br></br>
                • Capability to access education (i.e some people have the means to take education but chose not to) could be discussed and explored<br></br><br></br>
                • Measuring the quality of education in our country could provide us with more insights about the issues faced by the education system </p>
